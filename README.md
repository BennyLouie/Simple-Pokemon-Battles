### A Brief Summary

This is a very simple game that simulates a Pokemon Battle. There are no attributes or special attack moves.

User may login or signup.

User may also delete his/her account.

User can only choose to attack or defend.
Damage dealt is dependent on the attributes of the Pokemon which is not visible to the user.

After completing a battle, either a win or loss will be added to the user's battle history.

With each win, the selected Pokemon will gain 5 experience points.
Once the experience points reach the cap, the Pokemon levels up!
Upon leveling up, the Pokemon will receive 3 stat points the user may apply to anny of the current stats.

Once used up, the user will still be able to change his/her decisions provided he does not refresh or move to another page. Otherwise, the changes remain permanent.

User may enter the Safari to select a Pokemon from the first Generation to add to his/her team. (Upon initial signup the user has no Pokemon)

The team caps at 6.

User may also release a Pokemon from his/her team.
